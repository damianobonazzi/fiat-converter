# fiat-converter

Have you ever had to explain the price of something to a "fiat-coiner"?
You know, one of those who still lives using euros or dollars 🫣
And maybe you've even found yourself in the annoying situation of having to convert BTC to fiat to pay for a coffee in one of those places still stuck in the 20th century?
You know the struggle.

Well, get ready to live better:
💥 Fiat Converter has arrived 💥
👉 https://damianobonazzi.github.io/fiat-converter/

A web app that translates your SAT-based world into Fiat language - hassle free.

Because other conversion tools often:
❌ are based on a single exchange (with fluctuating prices)
❌ don't let you choose between BTC or SATs
❌ use periods or commas as separators – and when you paste the amount into the wallet, surprise! error!

Fiat Converter instead:
✅ Takes median price from multiple sources
✅ Lets you convert both BTC and SATs
✅ Lets you choose between a period or a comma, so your wallet doesn't freak out

How do I use it?
➡️ Go to fiat-converter
➡️ Enter the amount in fiat or BTC
➡️ Copy the result
➡️ Done! 🚀

Want to always have it at your fingertips?
📱 Android: Open Chrome, tap the three dots in the top right, then "Add to Home Screen"
🍏 iPhone: Open Safari, tap the share icon (the one with the arrow), then "Add to Home Screen"

TL;DR a simple web app to easy convert a Bitcoin output in the equivalent Fiat amount and viceversa, when you have to deal with fiatcoiners!

every help is welcome!
